# Learning LLM Development with Gemini

This is a personal project to learn the basics of working with Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically using **Gemini** by Google.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The main goal is to understand how to interact with Gemini models, make API calls, and experiment with simple LLM-based features. This is the starting point for building more advanced AI tools in the future.

## 🧠 What I'm Focusing On

- Setting up access to Gemini
- Running basic prompts
- Understanding how LLMs respond
- Learning through hands-on examples

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech

- Gemini API (via Google AI Studio or Vertex AI)
- Python or JavaScript (depending on experiments)
- Simple scripts and example files
